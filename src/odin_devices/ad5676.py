"""AD5676R device class.

This class implements support for the AD5676R DAC.

For device information, see datasheet pdf available at:
https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ad5672r_5676r.pdf

Core knowledge is that the device writes and reads 3 bytes at a time.
The first byte is a command and an address (4 bits each), the remaining two bytes are data.
